      <h3>
        JOAD offers barebow, recurve and compound archers the opportunity to
        learn range safety and proper shooting technique in an environment that
        also fosters focus, increased self-confidence, and team building skills.
        JOAD is open to any youth archer aged 8 to 20 and is designed to grow
        with the youth archer. Introductory JOAD classes teach the fundamentals
        of proper shooting form; as the young archer develops, they will learn
        more advanced techniques and earn achievement awards.
