          1. Crossbows, broadheads, guns, firearms, pets and alcoholic beverages
          are not allowed at the range.
        </h3>

        <h3 class="text-left ma-2">
          2. Any device that locks a bow at full or partial draw is not allowed
          at the range.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="text-left ma-2">
          3. Children under the age of twelve require adult supervision.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="text-left ma-2">
          4. No sky pulling. Sky pulling is holding the bow high and pulling
          back on the arrow while lowering the bow to a shooting position. If
          the arrow was accidently released during a sky pull the arrow could
          endanger other people.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="text-left ma-2">
          5. Members must sign a release, waiver and indemnity agreement.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="text-left ma-2">
          6. No backtracking on the field range. On the field range, take your
          bow and gear with you when you advance to pull your arrows. Do not
          walk back up the shooting lane.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="text-left ma-2">
          7. If searching for a lost arrow, place your bow in front of the
          target. Do not commence firing if you observe a bow in front of the
          target.
